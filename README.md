Traveling and Shipment Routing Using Genetic Algorithm:
The travelling salesman problem is one of the major applications of the genetic algorithm. 
For example, when a trip planner is asked to plan a trip, he would take the help of a genetic algorithm that reduces the tripâ€™s overall cost and reduces the time.
